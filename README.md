# Facebook-Analytics

In this Facebook page analysis project, I analyzed the Australian cosmetics company page. I answered the following questions: 

1.What type of posts are posted on the page? This tells the type including photos, videos, links, and status posts. 

2.Which post types are liked more by the users? 

3.What text should be posted? 

4.When to post? What is a good time to post content? 

5.Finally, user engagement analysis is shown.
